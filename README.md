# Pyarmor

Pyarmor is a command line tool used to import or run obfuscated Python scripts.

It protects Python scripts by the following ways:

* Obfuscate source file to protect constants and literal strings.
* Obfuscate byte code of each code object.
* Clear f_locals of frame as soon as code object completed execution.
* Expired obfuscated scripts, or bind to fixed machine.

Refer to [Protect Python Scripts By Pyarmor](docs/protect-python-scripts-by-pyarmor.md)

## Support Platforms

- Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and Python3
- Prebuilt Platform: win32, win_amd64, linux_i386, linux_x86_64, macosx_intel
- Embeded Platform: Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, TS-4600 / TS-7600

## Quick Start

### Installation

The simple way is pip

```
    pip install pyarmor
```

Or get source package from [pypi/pyarmor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyarmor)

Pyarmor is a command line tool, main script is pyarmor.py. After you
get source package, unpack it to any path, then run paramor.py as
common python script

```
    python pyarmor.py
```

If Pyarmor is installed  by pip, there is a command will be avaiable in Python script path

```
    pyarmor
```

### Basic Usage

The following examples show how to obfuscate a python package
**pybench**, which locates in the **examples/pybench** in the source
of pyarmor.

Obfuscate package **pybench** directly:

```
    python pyarmor.py obfuscate --src examples/pybench --entry pybench.py \
                                "*.py" "package/*.py"

    # Note that quotation mark is required for file patterns, otherwise
    # it will be expanded base on current path by shell.
    #
    # This command will create an extra file .pyarmor_capsule.zip in the
    # --src path, and save all the obfuscated scripts to default output
    # path "dist" in the current path
    #
    cd dist

    # Check obfuscated script
    cat pybench.py

    # Run obfuscated script
    python pybench.py
```

Use project to manage obfuscated scripts:

```
    mkdir projects
    python pyarmor.py init --src examples/pybench --entry pybench.py \
                           projects/pybench

    # This command will create 2 files: .pyarmor_config, .pyarmor_capsule.zip
    # in the project path "projects/pybench"
    cd projects/pybench

    # And there is a shell script "pyarmor" is created at the same time.
    # (In windows, the name is "pyarmor.bat")
    #
    # Now run command "build" to obfuscated all the scripts
    #
    ./pyarmor build

    # Check obfuscated script
    cd dist
    cat pybench.py

    # Run obfuscated script
    python pybench.py
```

There is a webui used to manage project easily. Start it

```
    # For windows
    src/webui/manager.bat

    # For linux
    src/webui/manager.sh

    # If Pyarmor is installed by pip
    pyarmor-webui
```

A good example is the best teacher. Here are several typical scenarios [src/examples](src/examples)

## License

Pyarmor is published as shareware. Free trial version never expires, the limitation is

- Project Capsule generated by trial version is NOT random, but FIXED by hardcode.

A registration code is required to generate random project capsule.

- Personal user: one registration code is enough.
- Company user: one registration code is only used for one project/product.

### Purchase

Click [Purchase](https://shopper.mycommerce.com/checkout/cart/add/55259-1),

A registration code will be sent to your immediately after payment is completed successfully.

After you receive the email which includes registration code, copy
registration code only (no newline), then replace the content of
"license.lic" with it.

### Check License

```
    python pyarmor.py --version
```

**The registration code is valid forever, it can be used permanently.**
