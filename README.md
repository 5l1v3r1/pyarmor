Pyarmor is a command line tool used to obfuscate python scripts, bind
obfuscated scripts to fixed machine or expire obfuscated scripts. It
protects Python scripts by the following ways:

* Obfuscate code object to protect constants and literal strings.
* Obfuscate byte code of each code object in runtime.
* Clear f_locals of frame as soon as code object completed execution.
* Expired obfuscated scripts, or bind to fixed machine.

Refer to [Protect Python Scripts By Pyarmor](docs/protect-python-scripts-by-pyarmor.md)

## Support Platforms

- Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and Python3
- Prebuilt Platform: win32, win_amd64, linux_i386, linux_x86_64, macosx_x86_64
- Embedded Platform: Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, TS-4600 / TS-7600

## Quick Start

### Installation

The simple way is pip

```
    pip install pyarmor
```

Or get source package from [pypi/pyarmor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyarmor)

Pyarmor is a command line tool, main script is pyarmor.py. After you
get source package, unpack it to any path, then run paramor.py as
common python script

```
    python pyarmor.py
```

If Pyarmor is installed  by pip, there is a command will be avaiable in Python script path

```
    pyarmor
```

And there is a `webui` used to obfuscate script in gui mode:

```
    pyarmor-webui
```

Note that the `webui` doesn't include all the features of Pyarmor, it
can help you to understand Pyarmor quickly.

### Basic Usage

The following examples show how to obfuscate a python package
**pybench**, which locates in the **examples/pybench** in the source
of pyarmor.

Obfuscate package **pybench** directly:

```
    python pyarmor.py obfuscate --src examples/pybench --entry pybench.py \
                                "*.py" "package/*.py"

    # Note that quotation mark is required for file patterns, otherwise
    # it will be expanded base on current path by shell.
    #
    # This command will create an extra file .pyarmor_capsule.zip in the
    # current path, and save all the obfuscated scripts to default output
    # path "dist" in the current path
    #
    cd dist

    # Check obfuscated script
    cat pybench.py

    # Run obfuscated script
    python pybench.py
```

Use project to manage obfuscated scripts:

```
    mkdir projects
    python pyarmor.py init --src examples/pybench --entry pybench.py \
                           projects/pybench

    # This command will create 2 files: .pyarmor_config, .pyarmor_capsule.zip
    # in the project path "projects/pybench"
    cd projects/pybench

    # And there is a shell script "pyarmor" is created at the same time.
    # (In windows, the name is "pyarmor.bat")
    #
    # Now run command "build" to obfuscated all the scripts
    #
    ./pyarmor build

    # Check obfuscated script
    cd dist
    cat pybench.py

    # Run obfuscated script
    python pybench.py
```
