Using PyArmor
=============

The syntax of the ``pyarmor`` command is:

    ``pyarmor`` [*command*] [*options*]

Obfuscating Python Scripts
--------------------------

Use command ``obfuscate`` to obfuscate python scripts. In the most
simple case, set the current directory to the location of your program
``myscript.py`` and execute::

    pyarmor obfuscate myscript.py

|PyArmor| obfuscates :file:`myscript.py` and all the :file:`*.py` in the same folder:

* Create :file:`.pyarmor_capsule.zip` in the ``HOME`` folder if it doesn't exists.
* Creates a folder :file:`dist` in the same folder as the script if it does not exist.
* Writes the obfuscated :file:`myscript.py` in the :file:`dist` folder.
* Writes all the obfuscated :file:`*.py` in the same folder as the script in the :file:`dist` folder.
* Copy runtime files used to run obfuscated scripts to the :file:`dist` folder.

In the :file:`dist` folder you find the obfuscated scripts you
distribute to your users::

    myscript.py

    pytransform.py
    _pytransform.so, or _pytransform.dll in Windows, _pytransform.dylib in MacOS
    pyshield.key
    pyshield.lic
    product.key
    license.lic

The last 6 files called ``Runtime Files``, all of them are required to
run the obfuscated script.

Normally you name one script on the command line. It's entry
script. The content of :file:`myscript.py` would be like this::

    from pytransfrom import pyarmor_runtime
    pyarmor_runtime()

    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x06\x0f...')

The first 2 lines called ``Bootstrap Code``, are only in the entry
script. They must be run before using any obfuscated file. For all the
other obfuscated :file:`*.py`, there is only last line::

    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x0a\x02...')

Run the obfuscated script::

    cd dist
    python myscript.py

By default, only the :file:`*.py` in the same path as the entry script
are obfuscated. To obfuscate all the :file:`*.py` in the sub-folder
recursively, execute this command::

    pyarmor obfuscate --recursive myscript.py

Generating License For Obfuscated Scripts
-----------------------------------------

Use command ``licenses`` to generate new :file:`license.lic` for
obfuscated scripts.

By default there is :file:`dist/license.lic` generated by command
``obfuscate``. It allows obfuscated scripts run in any machine and
never expired.

Generate an expired license for obfuscated script::

    pyarmor licenses --expired 2019-01-01 code-001

|PyArmor| generates new license file:

* Read data from :file:`.pyarmor_capsule.zip` in the ``HOME`` folder
* Create :file:`license.lic` in the ``licenses/code-001`` folder
* Create :file:`license.lic.txt` in the ``licenses/code-001`` folder

Overwrite default license with new one::

    cp licenses/code-001/license.lic dist/

Run obfuscated script with new license, It will report error after
Jan. 1, 2019::

    cd dist
    python myscript.py

Generate license to bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine, first
get hardware information::

    pyarmor hdinfo

Then generate new license bind to harddisk serial number and mac address::

    pyarmor licenses --bind-disk '100304PBN2081SF3NJ5T' --bind-mac '20:c1:d2:2f:a0:96' code-002

Run obfuscated script with new license::

    cp licenses/code-002/license.lic dist/

    cd dist/
    python myscript.py

Packing Obfuscated Scripts
--------------------------

Use command ``pack`` to pack obfuscated scripts into the bundle.

First install `PyInstaller`::

    pip install pyinstaller

Set the current directory to the location of your program
``myscript.py`` and execute::

    pyarmor pack myscript.py

|PyArmor| packs :file:`myscript.py`:

* Execute ``pyarmor obfuscate`` to obfuscate :file:`myscript.py`
* Execute ``pyinstaller myscipt.py`` to create :file:`myscript.spec`
* Update :file:`myscript.spec`, replace original scripts with obfuscated ones
* Execute ``pyinstaller myscript.spec`` to  bundle the obfuscated scripts

In the ``dist/myscript`` folder you find the bundled app you
distribute to your users.

Run the final executeable file::

    dist/myscript/myscript

Check the scripts have been obfuscated. It should return error::

    rm dist/myscript/license.lic
    dist/myscript/myscript

Generate an expired license for the bundle::

    pyarmor licenses --expired 2019-01-01 code-003
    cp licenses/code-003/license.lic dist/myscript

    dist/myscript/myscript

Note that command ``pack`` maybe doesn't work if ``.spec`` file of
PyInstaller_ has been customed. You need edit ``.spec`` file to pack
obfuscated scripts, See :ref:`How to pack obfuscated scripts`.
